# Hostel-Database-Management
A basic DBMS Project to manage the data of the students residing in the Hostel. 
This was made using MySQL at the XAMPP Server at the Local Host. 
I've also used some HTML, CSS and PHP to develop this project using the Visual Studio Code.

Install XAMPP to manage and host the project into your local Host
Install MySQL
Put all the files into your htdocs in your XAMPP folder for directly hosting the project
